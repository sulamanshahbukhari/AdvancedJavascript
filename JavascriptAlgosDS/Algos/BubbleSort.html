    // [def] Sorting algorithm 

    // problem statement: given an array of integers sort an array

    // [note]: bubble sort is a poor sorting algorithm and is primarily used for intro to sorting algorithms interview
    
    //idea : compare adjacent elements on different index and swap places 
   
    //psudocode
    // step 1 transverse through array from 1st index  and check if elemnt at current index > than adjacent index
    // cont: if adjacent index is smaller than currnet element swap there position 
    // step2: check if elements are swapped after first alteration using boolean value 
    // step3: if elements are not swapped and are not in sorted order redo the loop for that enclose the for loop with do while loop with condition swapped
    // finally exit the loop after the operation is completed
