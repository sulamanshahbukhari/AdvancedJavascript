    <h1>Reccurrsion</h1>
    <p>[def]: Recurrsion is a problem solving technique in ehich a problem is  broken down into smaller problems</p>
    <p> every recurssive solution needs to have a base case : a condition to terminate recurrsion</p>
    <b>Note</b>
    <p>Recurrsion may not be your best bet for solving a problem an iterative solution can serve the purpose for solving the problem in a better way</p>
