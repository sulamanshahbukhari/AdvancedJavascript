    // [def] Insertion Sorting algorithm : sorting can be in ascending and descending order

    // problem statement: given an array of integers ,sort the array

    // tutorial link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu_mDUIsTVE&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP&index=22

    //idea : virtually split the array in sorted and unsorted part 
    //      > since by def one part is always sorted we will assume that first element is already sorted 
    //      > we take that sorted first element and compare it with unsorted element of that array

    // psuedocode:
        //assumption:  since we assume to break down array into two parts such as sorted and unsorted array we assume that first element is always sorted
        // step 1 :star array from index 1 since 0 index for sorted element
        //specify Number to insert at i 
        // watch video for more clarity

    function insertionSort(arr) {  
        
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) //since sorted element always starts with first element i.e index 0 we start loop from first index
        {
            let numberToInsert=arr[i];
            let j=i-1; // here j is index of sorted element 
            while(j >= 0 && arr[j] > numberToInsert){
                arr[j+1]=arr[j]
                j=j-1;
            }
            arr[j+1]=numberToInsert;
            
            
        }
         
        
    }
     const arr =[8,20,-2,-4,-6];
     insertionSort(arr)
